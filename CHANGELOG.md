[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.32...8.2.33)

The scheduler content moderation integration module that we introduced with the last release now provides the required scheduler patch by itself.
That means, that we had to remove the patch from the distribution, otherwise installation will fail.

Additionally, we fix an update bug from the last release. While the update was correctly done in the release, the update was always marked as failed. To check, if your update
was successful, you can take a look at your media entity form-displays. You should have the inline form mode on your media entities.
For more information on this take a look at the corresponding drupal.org issue: https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/3027152

No features have been added.

- Fix [After update to 8.x-2.32 Pending Thunder updates message persists](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/3027152)
- Do [Move scheduler patch to integration module](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/3027869)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.25...8.2.26)

Fixes a bug, that we introduced with the last release.

- Fix [Disabled content_moderation breaks Thunder](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/3003428)

## [8.2.25](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.2.25) 2018-09-27
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.24...8.2.25)

With this release we introduce a content moderation integration. When Thunder is freshly installed, you will no longer have
a simple publish checkbox, but three moderation states to save into. This makes it possible to save a draft of an published
article without overwriting the published version.

Additionally it is possible to restrict the permission to publish an article to certain users. We introduced a new "restricted Editor" role
that is only able to create drafts, but not publish those drafts.

When updating from an earlier version of Thunder, you will not automatically get these changes, since it would break your
existing article workflow. If you want to enable the feature, just enable the content moderation module.

Since this functionality is based on Drupal core content moderation and workflow modules, it is possible to add as much
states and state changes to it as you like.

It is strongly recommended to also update to the most recent version of the Thunder admin theme.

Main changes since 8.2.24:

- Do [Be able to create and save a draft without changing the published article](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/2820056)
- Fix [Update tests fail after content moderation merge](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/3002190)

## [8.2.24](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.2.24) 2018-09-05
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.21...8.2.24)

With the release of Drupal 8.6 some features that were part of thunder for a long time have been integrated into Drupal
core. With this release we remove the duplicate functionality and rely on cores implementation:

- Core provides now status fields dor taxonomy terms. See https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2930996
- Profiles can have have true dependencies, we do not need a workaround for that anymore. See https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2952888
- Configurable redirects after installation. See https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2776605

We added select2 as a new UX feature for select lists and implemented it for the tags selection. This improves
the auto completion, reordering and deletion of tags.

Additionally we removed several deprecations from code and updated to the newest version of required modules. The update
of the entity_browser module also lead to a small UX improvement regarding replacing of images in the image paragraph.
Instead of two clicks - one for removing the old image, and one to add a new image - you can now replace existing
images with one click.

Main changes since 8.2.21:

- Do [Update to Entity Browser 1.5 and use newly available replace button](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/2980452)
- Do [Update to new diff release](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/2987483)

## [8.2.22](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.2.22) 2018-08-02

8.2.22 and 8.2.23 were releases without changes. They were necessary to update the drupal.org tar-ball.

## [8.2.21](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.2.21) 2018-07-19
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.20...8.2.21)

The release fixes some testing issues, updates some modules and prepares thunder installations for the next admin theme 
release.
The next admin theme will have seven as a base theme. In preparation for this, we enable the seven theme for you. If 
this fails for some reason enable it manually before updating to the thunder_admin theme 1.0.0!

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.19...8.2.20)

This contains the update to the most current paragraphs release. This also means that we switch to the
paragraphs "experimental" widget. The classic widget will still work, but it will not contain the Thunder specific
enhancements like adding paragraphs in between other paragraphs or splitting text paragraphs.
All the Thunder enhancements of paragraphs are now moved out of the distribution into the paragraphs_features module
and can all be enabled and disabled to your liking. While we suggest using the Thunder admin theme, we also made sure, 
that he paragraphs_features module works well with the seven theme.
On update, the paragraphs fields that we ship get automatically updated to the experimental widget and should behave,
as they did before. If you added some paragraph fields on your own, they will stay on the classic widget and will lose
the add in between button. To re-enable the functionality, you will have to manually change the paragraph widget to
experimental and enable the options you need in the widget settings. Options we provide are:

- Enable confirmation on paragraphs remove
- Enable add in between buttons
- Enable split text for text paragraphs

Changes since 8.2.19:

- Do [[META] Move to Paragraphs experimental Widget](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/2908887)
- Fix [Do not disable "Autocollapse" and "Collapse / Edit all" options](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder/issues/2979306)

Drupal 8.5.0 release fixes and test fixes. Also starting with this release we will have hard dependencies on the
config selector module, which is required for delivering configuration depending on activated modules.
Special note on Drupal 8.5.0 and the Google AMP integration: The lullabot AMP library is currently not compatible with
the drupal 8.5 dependencies, for this reason we provide the pc-magas/amp library instead.
Since we do not ship core patches anymore, we do not lock Drupal core anymore.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.6...8.2.7)

This release notably fixes a data loss bug, where changes in an inline entity form where not submitted when collapsing
the paragraph containing the inline entity form. The fix saves remote entities on collapsing a paragraph, this means,
that changes on a referenced entity are saved before the referencing article is changed!

This might be unexpected behaviour, but we renamed the collapse button to "Collapse and save" to reflect this change.

- Fix [Library not loaded in entity_browser form](https://www.drupal.org/node/2900431)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.2.3...8.2.4)

With this release we are introducing a new admin theme, while there are many obvious visual changes, we also introduced
some usability improvements.

### New features:

- The save button is now fix at the bottom of the screen, no more scrolling down long paragraph lists!
- All paragraphs have a compact, yet helpful preview mode. The preview also has the same height now for every
  paragraph type, which is easier to read and also easier to handle.
- We removed lot of form clutter, forms are much cleaner, margins and paddings are harmonized, unneeded borders
  around field groups are removed.
- Images and other media can be directly edited in the paragraph now, no mor extra click on that edit button,
  no more distracting pop up windows!
- The help texts are now hidden behind small buttons with question marks – so they don’t disturb the nice view but are
  there if you need them
- The sidebar handling for mobile devices has been improved. You can now open and close the bar when you use a small
  device

But this is all just the beginning. We will continue to improve the authoring experience step by step in the future.


### Some hints:

We try to update your paragraphs as good as possible, but if you have heavily modified your system, some paragraphs
will not be looking as we intended. If you want to provide a better look for your custom paragraphs you can do the
following:

For custom paragraph types, custom display settings "Preview" should be enabled and adjusted.
For media bundles we have provided "Paragraph preview" view mode. In order to have proper look for media paragraph,
in paragraph "Preview" view mode for media entity field "Rendered entity" formatter should be selected with view mode
"Paragraph preview". As an example, you can take a look at default image paragraph provided by Thunder.

For text fields that should be displayed in a preview of the paragraph, we are suggesting to use "Trimmed" the text
formatter with max 600 characters. As an example, you can take a look at default text paragraph provided by Thunder.

Additionally the new form display mode "Inline" has been added for media bundles. This form display mode is used for
displaying of inline entity form for media entities in paragraphs. As an example, you can take a look at default image
paragraph provided by Thunder.

If you would like to keep the old behaviour, just require "drupal/thunder_admin": "~1.0" in your root composer.json.

### Thank you:

Many thanks to all people involved in the Thunder authoring experience task force:

Jeannette Mayer, Jessica Simon, Claudia Herwig, Andreas Nickel, Steffen Schlaer, Nico Davis, Maria Pecenka,
Berta Leinweber, Miriam Fuchs, Franziska Fey

Very special thanks to Andreas Krauzberger and Andreas Sahle for being the masterminds and designers of all of this!

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.1.5...8.2.0)

Version 2.0 adds new functionality and improved updating to Thunder. We bumped the major version to 2 because there are
incompatibilities in the deployment. We removed the dependency on npm and bower for downloading javascript libraries.
To be able to install Thunder with composer you will have to add

    {
         "type": "composer",
         "url": "https://asset-packagist.org"
    }

to your repositories section in your composer.json and the extra section of the same file should look like this:

    "extra": {
        "installer-types": ["bower-asset"],
        "installer-paths": {
            "docroot/core": ["type:drupal-core"],
            "docroot/libraries/{$name}": [
                "type:drupal-library",
                "type:bower-asset"
            ],
            "docroot/modules/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"],
            "docroot/profiles/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-profile"],
            "docroot/themes/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-theme"],
            "drush/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-drush"]
        },
        "enable-patching": true
    },

Also remove this line from the post-install-cmd and post-update-cmd sections:

    "Thunder\\composer\\ScriptHandler::deployLibraries"

You can see those changes in the 2.x branch of [thunder project](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-project).

The following features have been added:

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.x-1.0-rc6...8.x-1.0)

Release of thunder 8.1.0. This is almost identical to the rc6. We fixed a small css bug, and added a fixed the version for
entity_reference_revisions to the one of rc6.

## [8.1.0-rc6](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.1.0-rc6) 2017-01-25
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.x-1.0-rc5...8.x-1.0-rc6)

This release candidate mainly improves the updater service and updates most contrib modules to the newest versions.
An exception to the updates are the blazy and slick modules, which do not work properly after update.
Additionally we now use the pecl yaml extension when validating our yml files, since it is more strict then the previously
used Symfony component.
lat but not least, we introduced fixed creation dates for the demo articles to prevent having articles with exactly the same creation dates.

## [8.1.0-rc5](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.1.0-rc5) 2016-12-01
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.x-1.0-rc4...8.x-1.0-rc5)

rc4 introduced a bug where part of the configuration could be invalid after updating under some circumstances. This release just fixes this update bug.
If you already upgraded to rc4 you can check if your update has the problem by exporting your configuration (do a drush config-export) and checking if the following files in the config directory are valid:

- entity_browser.browser.gallery_browser.yml
- entity_browser.browser.multiple_image_browser.yml

I you do not have these files, it is ok, if you have them open them and check that they do not look like this:

entity_browser.browser.gallery_browser.yml

```
display_configuration:
  auto_open: true
```

entity_browser.browser.multiple_image_browser.yml

```
widgets:
  7d7f8f45-f628-48a3-84a8-c962c73f39e8:
    settings:
      auto_select: true
  89532aea-140d-4b9e-96f4-2aa489c095cb:
    settings:
      auto_select: true
```

As you can see, those configurations would be incomplete. If your Files look similar to the other entity_browser.browser.* config files, everything is fine.
