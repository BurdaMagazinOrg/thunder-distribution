# Changelog

## [3.3.0-beta1](https://github.com/thunder/thunder-distribution/tree/3.3.0-beta1) 2019-07-08

The first public release of Thunder 3. Feature-wise it is currently identical to Thunder 2, but uses Drupal media instead
of the deprecated media_entity module. New installations should prefer this version to Thunder 2.
Update from Thunder 2 is not fully automated, several manual steps have to be executed, they are described here:

[How to update Thunder 2 to Thunder 3](https://thunder.github.io/thunder-documentation/update-2-to-3)

From now on, new features will only be added to Thunder 3. Thunder 2 will be maintained as long as Drupal 8.7 is 
maintained. 
Thunder 2 will not work with Drupal 9, you should consider updating as soon as possible!
