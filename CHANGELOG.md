## [8.1.0-rc6](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.1.0-rc6) 2017-01-25
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.x-1.0-rc5...8.x-1.0-rc6)

This release candidate mainly improves the updater service and updates most contrib modules to the newest versions. 
An exception to the updates are the blazy and slick modules, which do not work properly after update.
Additionally we now use the pecl yaml extension when validating our yml files, since it is more strict then the previously 
used Symfony component.
lat but not least, we introduced fixed creation dates for the demo articles to prevent having articles with exactly the same creation dates.

## [8.1.0-rc5](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/tree/8.1.0-rc5) 2016-12-01
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-distribution/compare/8.x-1.0-rc4...8.x-1.0-rc5)

rc4 introduced a bug where part of the configuration could be invalid after updating under some circumstances. This release just fixes this update bug.
If you already upgraded to rc4 you can check if your update has the problem by exporting your configuration (do a drush config-export) and checking if the following files in the config directory are valid:

- entity_browser.browser.gallery_browser.yml
- entity_browser.browser.multiple_image_browser.yml

I you do not have these files, it is ok, if you have them open them and check that they do not look like this:

entity_browser.browser.gallery_browser.yml

```
display_configuration:
  auto_open: true
```

entity_browser.browser.multiple_image_browser.yml

```
widgets:
  7d7f8f45-f628-48a3-84a8-c962c73f39e8:
    settings:
      auto_select: true
  89532aea-140d-4b9e-96f4-2aa489c095cb:
    settings:
      auto_select: true
```

As you can see, those configurations would be incomplete. If your Files look similar to the other entity_browser.browser.* config files, everything is fine.
