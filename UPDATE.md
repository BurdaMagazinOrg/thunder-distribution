# Update instructions Thunder 2 -> Thunder 3

These are the instructions to manually update to Thunder 3. The most
significant change is the migration to media in core.

We also removed some modules from our codebase. If you are using one of
following modules, please add them to the composer.json of your project.
* valiton/harbourmaster
* drupal/riddle_marketplace
* drupal/nexx_integration
* burdamagazinorg/infinite_module
* burdamagazinorg/infinite_theme

After that the following steps should be done for the update:
* Add drupal/media_entity ^2.0 to your composer.json
* Make sure that you use the "Media in core" branch for all your
media_* modules. (For the media modules in Thunder, we take care of that)
* Make sure that all your media_entity related code is moved to media.

See here for more information:
* [Moved a refined version of the contributed Media entity module to core as Media module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2863992)
* [FAQ - Transition from Media Entity to Media in core](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/media/faq-transition-from-media-entity-to-media-in-core#upgrade-instructions-from-media-entity-contrib-to-media-in-core)

All you need to do now is:
```
drush updb
```

## Additional not required tasks:

### Generic view for entity browser
Entity browser views now support contextual parameter. So we removed
views.view.image_browser.yml, views.view.video_browser.yml and
views.view.riddle_browser.yml and added a generic entity browser view
that gets filtered based on the allowed media types of the current
field.

The old views are still supported, but we would recommend to import
views.view.entity_browser.yml and use that in the entity browser.
