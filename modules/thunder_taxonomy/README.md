# Thunder taxonomy

This module contains configuration to Thunder's site-structure. By default Thunder offers 2 different taxonomies.

### Channel
The channel taxonomy represents the overall site-structure. It enables you to cluster your content for different topics.
This taxonomy is also used to represent your vertical navigation and is normally a multi-level structure. Each Article is assigned to exactly one channel.

### Tags
Tags are used for more specific clustering. Normally tags are flat and represent your horizontal navigation. An article can have multiple tags attached.
