# Thunder media

Media administration is one of Thunder's main focus. We try to compose all the useful media modules to have a 
out-of-the-box solution for media handling. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to create and reuse media elements.

Currently we cover the following use-cases:

* Multi-Upload of images
* Handle YouTube and Vimeo videos
* Integrate with instagram and twitter cards
+ Combining images to a gallery
* Reuse all the objects in different articles
