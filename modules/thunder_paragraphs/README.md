# Thunder paragraphs

Paragraphs basically represents the content part of your article. They give editors the freedom to structure the content as they want.
These module contains all our predefined paragraph types, which can be used out-of-the-box.

Currently there are:

- Gallery

### Gallery
Create a gallery by giving a name and select or upload some images. Galleries will be displayed as sliding images.

### Media
Include an image or a video where ever you want in your content. Just select an existing from the Media-Browser or upload a new one.

### Instagram
An Instagram link is everything you need for this paragraph. Thunder will do the rest for you.

### Twitter
Same as instagram, just for Twitter.

### Text
The text paragraph just contains a large WYSIWYG text field.

### Quote
