## Configuration

In Thunder's default configuration, the automated cron module is disabled. For correct functioning of non-local sites, crons should be configured properly.
There are two types of crons which should be configured:

* [Configure cron](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/setting-up-cron-for-drupal/configuring-cron-jobs-using-the-cron-command)
* [Configure the schedulers cron](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/scheduler/tree/README.txt?h=8.x-1.x) (Used for automated article publishing)
